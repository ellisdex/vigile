this is a student project created for our undergrad game design dissertation. this repo is intended for version control and backup of said game, mostly of the main .ink files and the CSS. if you're reading this i hope you like it!! <3

To play Vigile, please open PROTOTYPE -> index.html - this should work on most popular browsers and has been tested on Chrome, Firefox and Opera GX. Do not separate or edit files in the PROTOTYPE folder.

If you would like to mess with the variables in any way (change the date, add more money, etc.), or look at the code itself, please open INK EDITOR FILES -> story in the Inky editor program.
